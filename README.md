# Json to Csv Converter
A python script that will turn a bunch of json files into csv files, and one aggregate csv.

# How to use

1. Download the files from Github into a folder.
2. Run the python script (in terminal, use cd to navigate to the script directory, then use the command "python json-to-csv.py".)
3. You will be prompted for paths to the directory containing your json files, and the directory to save the resulting csv files in. Enter valid (existing) directories. (Leave the input empty to use the current directory. The program should exclude any files that don't end in '.json')
