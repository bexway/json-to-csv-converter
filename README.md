# Json to Csv Converter
A python script that will turn a bunch of json files into csv files, and one aggregate csv.

# How to use
It isn't quite done yet, but when it is, this is how it will work:

1. Download the files into a folder.
2. (optional) Put all your json files into one folder named "json"
3. (optional) Put the "json" folder in the same directory as the python script
4. Run the python script (in terminal, use cd to navigate to the script directory, then use the command "python json-to-csv.py".)
If you didn't perform the optional steps above, give the program two arguments: the first is the directory containing your json files. The second is the folder where you want them to be saved.
